The main and most complete variant of the scripts is the cbz_to_pdf_bars_folder. It features a middle step to allow re-organizing the single images in a folder before compiling the pdf.
Images are resized to 2160x1620 adding horizontal or vertical bars in order to match the target resolution size even when the starting image has a different form factor.
